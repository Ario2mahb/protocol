# SDK Overview

Rarible Protocol Software Development Kit enables applications to interact with Rarible protocol easily: query, issue, trade NFTs on any blockchain supported.

Currently, these blockchains are supported:

- Ethereum (mainnet, ropsten, rinkeby)
- Flow (currently on devnet only)
- Tezos (on granada testnet)

## Installation

Using SDK should be fast, easy and intuitive - that's for what we're aiming for.
Below you can see an example of implementation.

1. Install required packages using npm or yarn.

    For most of the projects, apart of the Rarible SDK we'll also need web3.

    ```
    npm install -D @rarible/sdk
    npm install web3
    ```

    or using yarn

    ```
    yarn add @rarible/sdk -D
    yarn add web3
    ```

2. Create a project with the JS framework of your choice (we'll be using NextJS here).

In order to properly set up the Rarible SDK we need to follow some standard web3 practices.

1. Grab ethereum object out of the global window object.
2. Use it to create a new instance of Web3.
3. Create new instance of EthereumWallet class.
4. Create Rarible SDK with a new instance of ethereumWallet, created in previous step.

In code it looks like that (using TypeScript):

```
// Imports
import Web3 from "web3";
import { createRaribleSdk } from "@rarible/sdk";
import { EthereumWallet } from "@rarible/sdk-wallet";


// Code
const { ethereum } = window as any;

const web3 = new Web3(ethereum);
const ethWallet = new EthereumWallet(ethereum);

const raribleSdk = createRaribleSdk(ethWallet, "staging");
```

Boomm! ðŸ‘Š

RaribleSdk object is ready for use.

Few more things:

1. If you're wondering what's "staging" in createRaribleSdk it's environment parameter. We have four options here:

    - prod (mainnet)
    - dev (ropsten)
    - staging (rinkeby)
    - e2e (you probably won't use this)

    The difference between them is the chain Id and the Rarible API endpoint.

2. If you're creating any sort of blockchain application which will interact with users you'll still need to implement connect metamask button in order to get their wallet connected.

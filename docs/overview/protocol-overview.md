# Overview

Rarible Multichain Protocol is a decentralized toolset that simplifies the way developers can work with NFTs. Protocol builds an abstraction layer for several blockchains and isolates the developer from their specifics with Multichain SDK.

Rarible Multichain SDK is fully blockchain-agnostic. You can find a list of supported blockchains on our [Features](../features.md) page.

We use different environments for blockchain networks. See actual information on [API Reference](../api-reference.md) page.

[Rarible Multichain SDK](https://github.com/rarible/sdk) enables applications to easily interact with Rarible Protocol: query, issue and trade NFTs on any blockchain supported. See more information on [Reference](../reference/reference-overview.md) section.

## Why build on Rarible protocol?

Rarible pursues the goal of creating a highly liquid environment for all NFTs out there: a robust on-chain protocol designed for NFTs to exist in a connected space. A separate initiative with a dedicated team will enable direct interactions with the protocol from multiple front ends like storefronts or wallets, offering additional distribution channels and enhancing liquidity. It will also fuel the discovery of new NFT trading mechanics.

NFT protocol designed by Rarible for all, owned and governed by the community. In this regard, a special place in the initiative is reserved for Rarible native governance token $RARI as the basic building block for the future NFT ecosystem.

## Supply and demand of the whole Rarible ecosystem

Rarible is one of the biggest NFT marketplaces out there with over $64 million in total lifetime volume and 57k monthly protocol users, slick UX, and a variety of use cases across industries. You can utilize the shared order book with Rarible.

## Advanced and robust tech done for you

Creating the tech from scratch is complicated and time-consuming. Rarible provides access to the tools that the team has been developing for the past 1,5 years, with wide functionality and data on all the NFTs created.

## Monetization

Rarible protocol enables arbitrary front-end fees: you can additionally monetize your creations.

## Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)

Rarible is steadily moving towards becoming a fully decentralized autonomous organization. The DAO will offer multiple opportunities for creators to get funding and exposure. It will incentivize people to build on top of the protocol, and we expect the DAO to reward the early builders.

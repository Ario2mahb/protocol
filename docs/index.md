# Rarible Protocol

Rarible Multichain Protocol is a decentralized toolset that simplifies the way developers can work with NFTs. Protocol builds an abstraction layer for several blockchains and isolates the developer from their specifics with Multichain SDK.

Rarible Multichain SDK is fully blockchain-agnostic. You can find a list of supported blockchains on our [Features](features.md) page.

title: How to create NFTs on Tezos Blockchain using Rarible
description: Tezos blockchain with Rarible API tutorial
---

### What is Tezos blockchain and how can you create NFTs on it (with code)?

Main properties of tezos are:

1. **Self-Amendment**
   In pursuit of a strong, united community, without the need for hard forks, they‚Äôve created a self-amendment algorithm that basically adapts proposed changes step by step (of course, only the ones accepted by the community). The algorithm is very strong, error-resistant and what there are currently a lot of different proposals for improvements.

2. **Proof Of Stake**
   It is always nice to have a proof of stake mechanism: faster transactions, insanely low fees compared to PoW chains like Ethereum.

3. **Smart Contracts**
   Tezos native smart contract‚Äôs language is Michelson, which facilitates formal verification.

As you can see, Tezos is a pretty stable option.

### How to get funds in Tezos test wallet

Before we can mint an NFT, we actually need to have some sort of asset to spend. We use ‚Äúfaucets‚Äù for that. A Faucet is basically a software that can pour some crypto into your test account. You can find detailed instructions on how to do it [here](https://usual-20something-guy.medium.com/tezos-faucet-how-to-get-free-tezos-for-hangzhou-test-blockchain-36fd188515b7).

### Creating NFTs on Tezos, programmatically

I am all about getting things done as fast and as efficiently as possible. That‚Äôs why we will use the **Rarible Protocol** for that. It allows you to create NFTs on a few blockchains right now, and one of them is Tezos (it also makes it very simple to do so). You can change your codebase from creating NFTs on Ethereum to Tezos in basically two lines. I also have a bonus for you. On Rarible, we‚Äôve created a [ready-to-code template](https://github.com/kolberszymon/union-sdk-template), with Next JS, Tailwind CSS, and already configured Rarible SDK, which you can just clone from GitHub and follow along. Since the code of the Union SDK (the one which is already set for you) is pretty complicated, we won‚Äôt dive into it in this article.

Ready-to-go code template, if you want to follow along: [https://github.com/kolberszymon/union-sdk-template](https://github.com/kolberszymon/union-sdk-template)

### 1. App file

We start by wrapping the whole app in SdkWalletConnecter and SdkContextProvider. Additionaly, we pick the desired wallet that we want to use in our project. Beacon is a provider that allows us to use Temple Wallet, which supports Tezos. üí°

If you want to change the appearance of the ‚Äúconnect wallet‚Äù button, you can do it in sdk-wallet-connector.tsx, specifically using the **Options** function.

### 2. Index File

The Index File is responsible for creating the view shown above.

### Pass Collection ID

Collection ID is in a format called the ‚ÄúUnion Address‚Äù. The Union Address is nothing more than the blockchain name in uppercase letters, followed by colon, followed by contract address. On most blockchain smart contracts there are accounts, just like any other, but with a few differences. They contain executable code. üë®‚Äçüíª

Examples of correct Union Addresses:

**ETHEREUM: 0x6ede7f3c26975aad32a475e1021d8f6f39c89d82**

**TEZOS: KT18vSGouhJcJZDDgrbBKkdCBjSXJWSbui3i**

When it comes to Rarible‚Äôs smart contract addresses, you can find most of them [here](https://docs.rarible.org/ethereum/contract-addresses/).

Unfortunately, some of them (e.g. Flow, Tezos) can change due to continuous development, so if the one shown on the docs doesn‚Äôt work, the best place to find the right one is on discord (Rarible Protocol). Just ping us there. üòâ

For Tezos, the address of the smart contract on Hangzhounet‚Äôs test network is:

**KT18vSGouhJcJZDDgrbBKkdCBjSXJWSbui3i.**

And you can see your test Tezos token by going to[ https://rinkeby.rarible.com/](https://rinkeby.rarible.com/) and selecting the Tezos blockchain on the explore dropdown.

### Pass Additional Parameters

![Screen we see after passing correct collection ID](./img/0*4m1q5RwFegi4s9Bj.png)

We use collection ID in order to determine a few things:

- If Union Address is correct

- If Lazy Mint is supported

- If Multiple Supply is allowed

You can look through the response object to see all the properties.

### Submitting Response Object To the Blockchain

After filling in all the wanted properties, it‚Äôs time to submit the transaction.

### Summary

And that‚Äôs it! It‚Äôs really simple, to be honest. Now let‚Äôs take a look at what we have learned:

- What Tezos is and what is special about it,

- Where to find the ready-to-code GitHub template,

- How to create an NFT on Tezos blockchain

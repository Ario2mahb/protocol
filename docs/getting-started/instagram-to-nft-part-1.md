# Instagram to NFT service with Rarible Protocol. Part 1

![Instagram to NFT service with Rarible Protocol](./img/instagram1_0.png)

In this tutorial, you're going to learn how you can build a [CocoNFT](../use-cases/coconft.md) clone. What is CocoNFT, you‚Äôd probably ask? It‚Äôs a service that allows you to mint your Instagram posts as NFTs.

Project is splitted into a 2 part series. Including everything into one article would feel overwhelming.

In the first part (the one you‚Äôre currently reading), we're going to explain how to let users Authorize their Instagram accounts on the app, so they can fetch their photos.

In the [second part](instagram-to-nft-part-2.md), we‚Äôre going to dive deeper into integrating the application with Metamask and many different wallets. This will allow users to interact with a bunch of different blockchains, such as Polygon, Ethereum, Flow, Tezos, to name a few. All of this will be done using Rarible Protocol APIs/SDK.

If you want to follow along with the finished code, here is the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kolberszymon/nftig).

## Create an Instagram App that can authorize a user

Since scraping websites like Facebook or Instagram is a daunting task, it‚Äôs much easier to just use their API, because, well‚Ä¶ they provide it. First, you have to go to the [Facebook for Developers website](https://developers.facebook.com/). There, you have to go to ‚ÄúMy Apps‚Äù.

<figure markdown>
![Right Top Corner of the Website](./img/instagram1_1.png){ width="800" }
</figure>

Click the big green button ‚ÄúCreate an app‚Äù (no screenshot included here, because you won‚Äôt miss it for sure).

<figure markdown>
![Choosing an App Type](./img/instagram1_2.png){ width="800" }
</figure>

After that, you can choose an app type. There are quite a few different types here, but let‚Äôs select ‚ÄúConsumer‚Äù.

<figure markdown>
![Apps Dashboard](./img/instagram1_3.png){ width="1000" }
</figure>

From here, we can set up more products. Since we‚Äôre focused on Instagram, click the ‚ÄúSet Up‚Äù button under the ‚ÄúInstagram Basic Display‚Äù option.

<figure markdown>
![Instagram Basic Display error](./img/instagram1_4.png){ width="1000" }
</figure>

From now on, you should see Instagram‚Äôs Basic Display on the left sidebar. If you‚Äôre following this tutorial, you should also see a big red error. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre going to solve it now.

Go to Settings > Basic. You can then see App ID and App Secret. While we‚Äôre on top of the page, you should also add the Privacy Policy URL and User Data Deletion. These fields are mandatory. What‚Äôs funny is that it can be a totally fake URL (that would kinda breach the ToS of Meta and GDPR, I think). It just needs to have HTTPS and return status 200. I‚Äôm using [httpstat.us/200](https://httpstat.us/200) which is basically a tool that always returns the 200 status code.

<figure markdown>
![Settings / Basic Page with Privacy Policy and User Data Deletion URL inserted](./img/instagram1_5.png){ width="1000" }
</figure>

There is one more thing that we have to do while we are still on the Settings / Basic page: adding a platform. Localize a big ‚Äú Add Platform‚Äù button on the bottom, click on it, and you should see the following popup. Select the website option.

<figure markdown>
![Popup, which appears after clicking the ‚ÄúAdd platform‚Äù button on the bottom of the page](./img/instagram1_6.png){ width="800" }
</figure>

Add a website URL.

<figure markdown>
![Okay, that‚Äôs all the configurations in Settings/Basic.](./img/instagram1_7.png){ width="400" }
</figure>

After we filled in all required URLs and added a platform, we are able to create a New App on Instagram Basic Display.

<figure markdown>
![Previously unavailable button on Instagram Basic Display](./img/instagram1_8.png){ width="1000" }
</figure>

You‚Äôll need to provide the correct URLs. This step is very important, because the Valid OAuth Redirect URI is an address where the Instagram Authorize window will redirect you with the Authorization Token as a query parameter. So in an ideal scenario, you would pass your backend API address here, save the token in the database, and then redirect the user to the proper page.

<figure markdown>
![Needed URIs](./img/instagram1_9.png){ width="600" }
</figure>

The next step is to add the following options to submission. They are required to allow us to fetch user data.

<figure markdown>
![Submissions which you have to add in order to be able to fetch user medias](./img/instagram1_10.png){ width="800" }
</figure>

Okay, the setup step is already done‚Ä¶ almost ü•∞.

You also have to add an Instagram test user to be able to use the Instagram API in development mode. You can do it by going to Roles / Roles on the sidebar, and adding Instagram testers.

<figure markdown>
![Instagram testers](./img/instagram1_11.png){ width="800" }
</figure>

Finally‚Ä¶ the last step. You have to agree on becoming a test user. You can do it by going to Instagram > Settings > Apps and Websites.

<figure markdown>
![Accepting the invitation](./img/instagram1_12.png){ width="800" }
</figure>

That‚Äôs the end of the 1st section. You‚Äôve learned:

* How to create a Facebook App
* How to create an Instagram App
* How to invite a Test User

## Get all necessary tokens needed to get user medias

When it comes to the tokens, we‚Äôll need:

**1. Authorization Token** ‚Äî The one we receive after informing we want to authorize our app. The Authorization Token is one-time usage only, but if you mess this step up don‚Äôt worry, you can always show it again.

<figure markdown>
![Authorize App screen](./img/instagram1_13.png){ width="400" }
</figure>

**2. Short-Lived Token** ‚Äî At this stage, we have an Authorization Token, which we can trade for the Short-Lived Token. It allows us to query the Instagram API for 60 minutes! That‚Äôs where its name came from. But we can also go one step further, and trade it for‚Ä¶

**3. Long-Lived Token** ‚Äî After obtaining it, you‚Äôre able to use it for up to 60 days. You‚Äôre also able to extend it after 24 hours from creating it. What it means in practice, is that you will not have to ask a user for an Authorization again. Big UX win! üëä

Before we learn how we can obtain it, you should prepare the two values below. They will interchange in a lot of requests.

* `APP_ID`
* `APP_SECRET`

We can get both of them on the FB For Developers Instagram Panel.

### Authorization Token

In order to retrieve the Authorization Token, first, we have to prepare the following URL:

```
https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=6201234567890178&redirect_uri=https://httpstat.us/200&scope=user_profile,user_media&response_type=code
```

You‚Äôll need a few parameters here. `client_id`,` redirect_uri`, the scope of granted access. We talked about all of them earlier. After the URL creation, simply paste it to the browser. Then, the authorize page will pop up like it was shown earlier. Click on Authorization, and it will take you to the Redirect URI, which you‚Äôve provided, but (and that‚Äôs the fun part) with an added code parameter. An example of a URL looks like this:

```
https://httpstat.us/200?code=AQBvJwCZtYdj1zLH_5myoAA1GRRpDhs1vcHFMzB4gvRk6dLkq5dNd24EVZ5FD9WoqQhfSuo6arUB17MPu2gRqEzP6EpsAl-9_2eC9-L6mWYQdWDyarkwDSNEs8T3gvoH-WLMHzhwwd6DJqP5PxJGf2ve53m7aGMEua3MzV8FZQVz5AfwWPN3G87n25jMBGgGGVj6G4pxJ9HqzNKmdpYK8GHKnRn_G03scHtUraFlEX5faCvz6ZO7Xw#_
```

This is the code we require, so copy it and delete the last two characters, ‚Äú#\_‚Äù to be precise. They are always added, and you have to delete them.

### Short-Lived Token

In order to obtain this one, we‚Äôll need to do a POST request with form data added. We‚Äôll need:

* `CLIENT_ID` ‚Äî which you can grab on FB For Developers / Instagram Display Page, it‚Äôs called App ID on the page
* `CLIENT_SECRET` ‚Äî same as above, only it‚Äôs located to the right
* `GRANT_TYPE` ‚Äî ‚Äúauthorization_code‚Äù
* `REDIRECT_URI` ‚Äî redirection URI which you‚Äôve provided
* `CODE` ‚Äî authorization token which we obtained in the previous step

If you‚Äôre using Postman, which I highly recommend for doing HTTP requests, your page should look similar to mine. Names in between curly braces are called Environment Variables. You can set them in global, and reuse them throughout the app.

```
https://api.instagram.com/oauth/access_token
```

<figure markdown>
![Needed form parameters presented in Postman](./img/instagram1_14.png){ width="800" }
</figure>

After sending a successful request, you should see the following answer.

<figure markdown>
![Example response object](./img/instagram1_15.png){ width="600" }
</figure>

If you mess something up, just read the error description and repeat the step to obtain the Authorization Token. Remember that it can only be used once. Going back to response values, `access_token` is our short-lived token, and `user_id` is, well, our user ID. It doesn‚Äôt change at all, so you can also store it in the Global Vars on Postman.

Congratulations! You‚Äôre now able to fetch user data! For now, it‚Äôs valid only for 60 minutes, so let‚Äôs work on that right now.

### Long-Lived Token

In order to change the Short-Lived Token into the Long-Lived one, you‚Äôre going to have to do a GET request to this address:

```
https://graph.instagram.com/v13.0/access_token?client_secret={{APP_SECRET}}&access_token={{ACCESS_TOKEN}}&grant_type=ig_exchange_token
```

<figure markdown>
![View in Postman](./img/instagram1_16.png){ width="600" }
</figure>

In exchange, you‚Äôll get a self-explanatory response. Grab an access_token value, and you‚Äôre good to go. You have a Long-Lived Token, now!

<figure markdown>
![Response with long-lived token example](./img/instagram1_17.png){ width="600" }
</figure>

## Fetch media details

We‚Äôve come a long way, but we‚Äôre finally here! After creating an Instagram App and getting a Long-Lived Token, we‚Äôre now ready to do some coding.

Since we don‚Äôt really have an HTTPS on localhost, we‚Äôll just use an `access_token` straight from the code. If you‚Äôd like to go live with that, you just need to change a few things. Maybe create some sort of backend API, replace the Instagram Redirect URI to your website‚Äôs one, and take it from there. This is just for tutorial purposes, so I won‚Äôt do that here. Of course, there are a lot of different ways to achieve the same goal, so it‚Äôs better to focus on concepts here.

The URLs which you‚Äôll need in order to get those data are:

**1. Fetch IDs of user media**

```
https://graph.instagram.com/v13.0/{{USER_ID}}/media?access_token={{LONG_LIVE_TOKEN}}&fields=id,timestamp
```

<figure markdown>
![Example response](./img/instagram1_18.png){ width="800" }
</figure>

Ids are the `MEDIA_ID`.

**2. Fetch media URL, using previously obtained IDs**

```
https://graph.instagram.com/v13.0/{{MEDIA_ID}}/media?access_token={{LONG_LIVE_TOKEN}}&fields=media_url,media_type
```

Where `MEDIA_ID` are the IDs fetched earlier.

Finally, ‚Äî here comes my favourite part: 

**To the code soldiers!** ü•≥

Compared to the work that we‚Äôve already done, it will be pretty quick.

**1. Fetch IDs of users‚Äô media**

<figure markdown>
![Fetching media IDs](./img/instagram1_19.png){ width="800" }
</figure>

**2. Fetch portion of retrieved posts**

Since there is an API requests rate limit, which equals 200 requests per hour per token, I prefer to fetch posts in portions when a user actually wants to fetch more than X. Thanks to that, we‚Äôre saving our requests rate, as well as internet throughput.

<figure markdown>
![Fetching portion of posts](./img/instagram1_20.png){ width="800" }
</figure>

**3. Display fetched media**

<figure markdown>
![Mapping over created MediaDetail array](./img/instagram1_21.png){ width="800" }
</figure>

In the final step, you just have to map the media details array and use `media_url` as an image source.

## Summing it up

We know that the article was quite big, but look how much you've done. You‚Äôve created an Instagram App, set it up, authorized a user, created a long-lived token, fetched IDs of users‚Äô media, got media URLs, and in the final step, displayed it.

Feel free to read it again, especially the token creation part, just to understand better how the flow works.

In the [second part](instagram-to-nft-part-2.md), you'll implement the NFT creation out of Instagram posts.

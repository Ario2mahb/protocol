# Install Rarible SDK

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @rarible/sdk -D
yarn add web3@1.5.0
yarn add tslib@2.3.1
```

Also, you can install ethers if you need it to initialize the wallets:

```shell
yarn add ethers
```

Make sure the SDK is installed correctly:

```shell
npm view @rarible/sdk version
```

## Initialize wallets

To use SDK, you have to create a Wallet â€” abstraction to communicate with real blockchain wallets.

Read more about initializing wallets on [Wallets](wallets.md) page.

## Using SDK on client application

SDK is written in TypeScript. You can use typings to explore SDK possibilities.

```ts
import { createRaribleSdk } from "@rarible/sdk"
```
